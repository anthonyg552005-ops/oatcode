- Contact form that goes to customer's email

## üìä TEST 7: DATABASE TRACKING

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue 1: How does system get customer's REAL business info?
**Problem**: Demo uses Thompson & Associates (fake). But when real customer pays, how do we get:
- Their real business name
- Their real services
- Their real phone/email
- Their real address

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Add form fields to Stripe checkout (collect business info)
2. Email customer after payment asking for info
3. Use their email domain to research business info

**Status**: ‚è≥ Need to implement

### Issue 2: Demo vs Production Website Storage
**Problem**: Where do production websites live?
- Demos: `/public/demos/`
- Production: `/public/customers/[customer-id]/` ?

**Status**: ‚è≥ Need to implement

### Issue 3: Custom Domain Setup (Premium)
**Problem**: How does customer actually get TheirBusiness.com?
- Do we auto-purchase via Namecheap?
- Do we email them asking what domain they want?
- What if domain is taken?

**Status**: ‚è≥ Need to implement
