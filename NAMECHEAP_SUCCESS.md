## 💰 Business Model:

## 🚀 How It Works (100% Autonomous):

1. **Customer signs up for Premium plan** ($297/mo)

2. **AI checks domain availability:**
   ```javascript
   const available = await global.autoDomain.checkAvailability('austindentalcare.com');
   // Returns: { available: true, domain: 'austindentalcare.com' }
   ```

3. **AI purchases domain:**
   ```javascript
   const result = await global.autoDomain.setupCustomDomain(
     'austindentalcare.com',
     customerInfo  // name, email, address, etc.
   );
   ```

4. **AI configures DNS automatically:**
   - A record: `austindentalcare.com` → 172.248.91.121
   - A record: `www.austindentalcare.com` → 172.248.91.121

5. **Customer's website goes live:**
   - URL: `http://austindentalcare.com`
   - Time: 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
   - SSL: Can add later via Cloudflare (free)

6. **You profit:**
   - Monthly revenue: $297
   - Annual revenue: $3,564
   - Annual cost: ~$10 (domain)
   - **Annual profit: $3,554 per customer**

## 📈 Scaling Economics:

| Customers | Annual Revenue | Annual Costs | Annual Profit |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 Premium | $3,564 | $10 | **$3,554** |
| 5 Premium | $17,820 | $50 | **$17,770** |
| 10 Premium | $35,640 | $100 | **$35,540** |
| 25 Premium | $89,100 | $250 | **$88,850** |
| 50 Premium | $178,200 | $500 | **$177,700** |
| 100 Premium | $356,400 | $1,000 | **$355,400** |
