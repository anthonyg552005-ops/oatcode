### Step 4: Test Support Email (1 minute)

Once DNS is propagated, send a test email:

2. **Send to**: support@oatcode.com
3. **Subject**: "Test support request"
4. **Body**: "Hi, I need help with pricing. How much does your service cost?"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Email not arriving at webhook?

**Check DNS:**
```bash
dig MX support.oatcode.com
```
- Should return: `mx.sendgrid.net`
- If not, MX record not propagated yet (wait longer)

**Check SendGrid:**
- Login to SendGrid
- Go to Activity ‚Üí Inbound Parse
- Should show received emails
- Check for errors

**Check Server:**
```bash
ssh root@24.144.89.17
pm2 logs oatcode-web | grep "inbound-email"
```

**Check Webhook:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://24.144.89.17/webhook/inbound-email/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","name":"Test","subject":"Test","message":"Hello"}'
```
Should return JSON with AI response.

### AI not responding?

**Check OpenAI API Key:**
```bash
ssh root@24.144.89.17
cat /var/www/automatedwebsitescraper/.env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Check SendGrid API Key (for sending):**
```bash
cat /var/www/automatedwebsitescraper/.env | grep SENDGRID_API_KEY
```

**Restart server if needed:**
```bash
ssh root@24.144.89.17
pm2 restart oatcode-web
```

### Emails going to spam?

This shouldn't happen with proper setup, but if it does:
1. Check SPF/DKIM records in SendGrid
2. Verify sender domain authentication
3. Add support@oatcode.com to contacts
4. SendGrid has good reputation, should land in inbox
