# 🧠 Project Learning System

## Overview

Your autonomous AI continuously monitors your **website-scraper** project and automatically adopts successful systems, patterns, and improvements into this automated business.

**Key Benefit**: As you work on and improve website-scraper, this AI automatically learns from it and gets better!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Daily Scanning (3 AM)**
Every day at 3 AM, the AI:
1. Scans `/Users/anthonygarcia/projects/website-scraper`
2. Identifies new systems and improvements
3. Uses GPT-4 to analyze if they would help this business
4. Automatically adopts high-impact improvements
5. Notifies you of major adoptions

### **AI-Powered Analysis**
For each system found, GPT-4 analyzes:
- Would this significantly improve our business?
- What specific improvements would it bring?
- What's the estimated impact? (High/Medium/Low)
- Should we adopt it immediately?
- Any modifications needed for our use case?

### **Automatic Adoption**
High-impact systems are adopted automatically:
- Code is copied/adapted from website-scraper
- Integrated into our autonomous business
- Tested and validated
- Logged in adoption history
