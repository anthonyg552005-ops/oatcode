## 🚀 Setup Steps (10 Minutes)

### Option 1: SendGrid Inbound Parse (Recommended - Free)

SendGrid can receive emails and forward them to your webhook.

#### Step 1: Configure SendGrid Inbound Parse

1. **Go to SendGrid Settings**
   - Login to: https://app.sendgrid.com/
   - Navigate to: Settings → Inbound Parse

2. **Add Inbound Parse Webhook**
   - Click "Add Host & URL"
   - **Receiving Domain**: `oatcode.com`
   - **URL**: `http://24.144.89.17/webhook/inbound-email`
   - **Spam Check**: Enabled
   - Click "Add"

3. **Add MX Record to Your Domain**

   Go to your domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.) and add this MX record:

   ```
   Type: MX
   Host: support (or @oatcode.com)
   Value: mx.sendgrid.net
   Priority: 10
   TTL: Auto or 3600
   ```

   **Example for Namecheap:**
   - Type: MX Record
   - Host: support
   - Value: mx.sendgrid.net
   - Priority: 10

4. **Verify Setup**

   After DNS propagates (5-30 minutes), send a test email to:
   ```
   support@oatcode.com
   ```

   Check your server logs:
   ```bash
   ssh root@24.144.89.17
   pm2 logs oatcode-web
   ```

---

### Option 2: Email Forwarding (Quick Alternative)

If you don't have oatcode.com domain set up yet, forward support emails to a webhook processor:

1. **Set up email forwarding** in your domain settings:
   - Forward `support@oatcode.com` → webhook service like:
     - CloudMailin (free tier available)
     - Mailgun Inbound Routes
     - AWS SES

2. **Configure webhook** to POST to:
   ```
   http://24.144.89.17/webhook/inbound-email
   ```

---

### Option 3: Temporary Gmail Solution

For immediate testing before domain setup:

1. **Update the success page** to show Gmail instead:

   Edit: `public/purchase-success.html`

   Change:
   ```html
   support@oatcode.com
   ```

   To:
   ```html
   anthonyg552005@gmail.com
   ```

2. **Manually forward emails** to the bot test endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://24.144.89.17/webhook/inbound-email/test \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "customer@example.com",
       "name": "Customer Name",
       "subject": "Question about pricing",
       "message": "How much does your service cost?"
     }'
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Test (Already Works!)
```bash
node test-support-bot.js
```

### Live Webhook Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://24.144.89.17/webhook/inbound-email/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "name": "Test Customer",
    "subject": "Test support request",
    "message": "I need help with my website"
  }'
```

### Real Email Test
Once MX records are configured:
1. Send email to: `support@oatcode.com`
2. Check server logs: `ssh root@24.144.89.17 && pm2 logs`
3. You should receive an AI-generated response within seconds!
