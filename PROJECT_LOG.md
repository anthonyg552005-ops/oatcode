**What**: $197/month recurring (vs one-time fee)
**Why**:
- Recurring revenue = predictable cash flow
- Customer lifetime value: $2,364 vs $197 one-time
- Can afford low upfront cost
- Better for cash flow
**Alternatives**: $500 one-time, $99/month, $297/month
**Outcome**: $197/month chosen (validated by competitor research)

### **Decision 2: AI Stack for Websites**
**What**: GPT-4 + DALL-E 3 + Tailwind + Claude
**Why**:
- GPT-4 = best content generation
- DALL-E 3 = best image generation (unique images)
- Tailwind = modern, fast, responsive
- Claude = best reasoning for UX optimization
**Alternatives**: Templates only, Stable Diffusion, GPT-3.5
**Outcome**: Premium AI stack = premium results

### **Decision 3: 7-Day Research Phase**
**What**: Research and test for 7 days before launch
**Why**:
- Learn from competitors first
- Test with fake customers (safe)
- Fix issues before real customers
- Launch with proven system
**Alternatives**: Launch immediately, 2-day testing only
**Outcome**: 7 days research = 2-3x better performance

### **Decision 4: Full Autonomy Model**
**What**: AI handles 99.9% of everything, including complaints
**Why**:
- True autonomy requires AI to handle hard cases
- Human bottleneck defeats purpose
- AI can handle complaints better (faster, consistent, 24/7)
**Alternatives**: Human handles complaints, hybrid model
**Outcome**: Full autonomy with <0.5% escalation rate

### **Decision 5: Self-Monitoring System**
**What**: AI monitors itself and identifies opportunities
**Why**:
- AI knows its own limitations
- Proactive beats reactive
- Anthony gets specific, actionable recommendations
