## ⚠️ WHAT'S MISSING (Critical Gaps)

### 🗄️ Database (0% Complete) ❗ CRITICAL
**Current State:**
- Everything stored in memory (lost on restart)
- No customer data persistence
- No lead history
- No payment tracking

**What You Need:**
```bash
# Option 1: PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
- Railway PostgreSQL addon (free tier available)
- Persistent customer records
- Transaction history
- Lead database

# Option 2: SQLite (Quick start)
- Already have sqlite3 in package.json
- Good for MVP/testing
- Easy migration to Postgres later
```

**Impact:** 🔴 **HIGH** - You'll lose all customer data on restart

---

### 💳 Stripe Webhook Integration (30% Complete) ❗ IMPORTANT
**Current State:**
- Stripe API keys configured ✅
- Payment links created ✅
- No webhook endpoint ❌
- No automatic customer creation on payment ❌

**What You Need:**
```javascript
// Add to src/routes/stripe.js
router.post('/webhook/stripe', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    // Extract customer data
    const session = event.data.object;

    // Determine tier from price
    const tier = session.amount_total === 29700 ? 'premium' : 'standard';

    // Create customer automatically
    await fetch('/api/customer/purchase', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: session.customer_email,
        businessName: session.metadata.businessName,
        tier: tier
      })
    });
  }
});
```
