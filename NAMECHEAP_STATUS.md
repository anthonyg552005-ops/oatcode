## ‚ö†Ô∏è  PENDING - REQUIRES YOUR ACTION

**Issue:** Namecheap API returning error 1011102: "API Key is invalid or API access has not been enabled"

**What this means:** The API credentials are configured but not yet activated by Namecheap.

## üîß WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

### Step 1: Verify Namecheap Settings

Go to: **https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/**

Check ALL of these:

- [ ] **API Access** toggle is ON (green/enabled)
- [ ] **Account balance** is $50+ (you should have $50)
- [ ] **IP whitelisted:** 172.248.91.121 is in the list
- [ ] **API Key** is visible and matches: `c1f65b3874824f0877df749595839Gc`

### Step 2: If API Key is Missing or Different

1. Click "Regenerate API Key" or "Generate New Key"
2. Copy the EXACT key (entire string, no spaces)
3. SSH to your Droplet
4. Edit .env file:
   ```bash
   nano /root/automatedwebsitescraper/.env
   ```
5. Update this line:
   ```bash
   NAMECHEAP_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
   ```
6. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

### Step 3: Wait for Activation

- API activation typically takes **5-60 minutes**
- Sometimes up to 24 hours for new accounts
- Try testing again in 30 minutes

### Step 4: Test Again

SSH to Droplet and run:
```bash
cd /root/automatedwebsitescraper
node test-namecheap.js
```

**Expected success output:**
```
‚úÖ Namecheap API working!
Domain check result: { available: true, domain: 'test-oatcode-example.com', price: 10.98 }
```

### Step 5: If Still Failing After 1 Hour

Contact Namecheap support:
- Go to: https://www.namecheap.com/support/live-chat/
- Say: "I enabled API access with $50+ balance and whitelisted IP 172.248.91.121, but I'm getting error 1011102. Can you verify my API is active?"
- Provide username: **garcaous**

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS CHECKLIST

1. [ ] Go to Namecheap API settings page
2. [ ] Verify all settings are correct (see Step 1 above)
3. [ ] Regenerate API key if needed
4. [ ] Wait 5-60 minutes for activation
5. [ ] Run test: `node test-namecheap.js`
6. [ ] If fails after 1 hour, contact Namecheap support

**Bottom Line:** Everything is configured correctly on our end. We're just waiting for Namecheap to activate the API access. This usually happens within an hour of enabling it with $50+ balance.
