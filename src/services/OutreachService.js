2. ${intelligence.ownerName ? `Addresses ${intelligence.ownerName} by name` : 'Addresses the business owner'}
3. References something SPECIFIC (their great reviews, award, years in business, etc.)
4. Identifies their pain point (no website, hard to find online, outdated site)
5. Offers a free demo website as solution
6. Explains clear benefit (more customers finding them)
7. Keeps it warm, conversational, and SHORT (3-5 sentences max)
8. Includes clear call-to-action
