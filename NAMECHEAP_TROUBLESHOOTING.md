# Namecheap API Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: API Key Invalid or Not Enabled

**Error:** `API Key is invalid or API access has not been enabled` (Error 1011102)

This error means Namecheap is not accepting the API credentials. Here's how to fix it:

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Verify Account Balance
1. Go to: https://ap.www.namecheap.com/billing/balance
2. Confirm balance is **$50 or more**
3. If not, add funds and wait 5 minutes

### Step 2: Enable API Access
1. Go to: https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/
2. Look for "API Access" section
3. **CRITICAL:** Make sure the toggle is **ON** (green)
4. Status should say: "API Access Enabled"
5. If you just enabled it, wait 5-10 minutes for activation

### Step 3: Verify Whitelisted IP
1. On the same page: https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/
2. Scroll to "Whitelisted IPs"
3. Confirm **172.248.91.121** is in the list
4. If not, add it and click "Save"

### Step 4: Verify API Key
1. On the same page, look for "API Key" section
2. Your API key should be displayed (or click "Generate" if not)
3. **CRITICAL:** Copy the EXACT key (no spaces, complete string)
4. Current key in .env: `c1f65b3874824f0877df749595839Gc` (31 characters)
5. If different, update .env file with correct key

### Step 5: Check for Production vs Sandbox
1. Make sure you're enabling API for **PRODUCTION** (not sandbox)
2. Sandbox API requires different credentials
3. For real domain purchases, you need production API enabled

## üîß HOW TO FIX

### Option 1: Regenerate API Key

If the API key might be wrong:

1. Go to: https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/
2. Click "Regenerate API Key" or "Generate New Key"
3. Copy the NEW key (entire string, no spaces)
4. Update .env file:

```bash
NAMECHEAP_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
```

5. Wait 5 minutes for activation
6. Test again

### Option 2: Wait for Activation

If you just enabled API access:

1. API activation can take **5-60 minutes**
2. Sometimes up to 24 hours for new accounts
3. Try testing again in 30 minutes

### Option 3: Contact Namecheap Support

If nothing works:

1. Go to: https://www.namecheap.com/support/live-chat/
2. Ask: "I enabled API access and whitelisted my IP, but getting error 1011102. Can you verify my API is active?"
3. Provide:
   - Username: garcaous
   - IP: 172.248.91.121
   - Error: "API Key is invalid or API access has not been enabled"

## üß™ TEST COMMANDS

### Test 1: Basic API Access
```bash
node -e "
require('dotenv').config();
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.namecheap.com/xml.response', {
  params: {
    ApiUser: process.env.NAMECHEAP_API_USER,
    ApiKey: process.env.NAMECHEAP_API_KEY,
    UserName: process.env.NAMECHEAP_USERNAME,
    Command: 'namecheap.users.getPricing',
    ClientIp: process.env.NAMECHEAP_CLIENT_IP,
    ProductType: 'DOMAIN'
  }
}).then(r => {
  if (r.data.includes('Status=\"OK\"')) {
    console.log('‚úÖ API is working!');
  } else {
    console.log('‚ùå API Error:');
    console.log(r.data);
  }
});
"
```

### Test 2: Domain Check
```bash
node test-namecheap.js
```

If you see `Status="OK"` in the response, API is working!

## üìã COMMON CAUSES

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Just enabled API | Wait 5-60 minutes for activation |
| API key copied wrong | Regenerate key and copy exactly |
| Balance too low | Add funds to reach $50+ |
| Wrong IP | Verify 172.248.91.121 is whitelisted |
| Sandbox mode | Enable production API, not sandbox |
| New account | May take up to 24 hours to activate |

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO CHECK RIGHT NOW

1. **Go to Namecheap API settings page:** https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/

2. **Verify these are TRUE:**
   - [ ] API Access toggle is ON (green)
   - [ ] Account balance is $50+
   - [ ] IP 172.248.91.121 is whitelisted
   - [ ] API Key matches the one in .env file
   - [ ] Production API is enabled (not just sandbox)

3. **If any are FALSE:** Fix them, wait 5 minutes, test again

4. **If all are TRUE:** Wait 30-60 minutes for API activation

---

## üìß NEXT STEPS

Once API is working, you'll see:

```bash
‚úÖ Namecheap API working!
Domain check result: { available: true, domain: 'test.com', price: 10.98 }
```

Then the system will be ready to autonomously purchase domains for Premium customers!

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTE

**Current Status:** API credentials are configured but not yet activated by Namecheap.

**Action Required:**
1. Check the verification checklist above
2. Regenerate API key if needed
3. Wait for activation (5-60 minutes typical)
4. Test again with: `node test-namecheap.js`

The code is correct - we just need Namecheap to activate the API access!
