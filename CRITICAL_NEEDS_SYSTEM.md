# 🚨 Critical Needs Monitoring System

## Overview

Your AI is **fully autonomous** but sometimes needs resources that only you can provide. The AI now monitors itself and **proactively alerts you** when it needs your help to succeed.

---

## 🎯 What It Monitors

### **6 Critical Resource Needs**:

1. **🌐 Professional Domain** - localhost looks unprofessional
2. **📧 Email Limits** - SendGrid daily/monthly quotas
3. **🤖 API Quotas** - OpenAI usage limits
4. **💳 Stripe Setup** - Payment processing
5. **📱 Phone Number** - Twilio SMS capability
6. **☁️ Cloud Hosting** - 24/7 availability

---

## 📧 Email Notifications

### **When?**
- **Every hour**: Checks for blocking issues
- **Immediately**: Emails CRITICAL needs
- **6-hour cooldown**: Avoids spam on same issue

### **Urgency Levels**:

**🚨 CRITICAL** (Immediate action required)
- Business is STOPPED or BLOCKED
- Example: "Email limit reached - cannot send more emails"
- Impact: Zero progress until resolved

**⚠️ HIGH** (Action needed soon)
- Business is IMPACTED
- Example: "Using localhost - reducing conversions 30-50%"
- Impact: Reducing performance significantly

**📋 MEDIUM** (Helpful but not urgent)
- Business works but could be better
- Example: "Twilio phone number would increase reach 30%"
- Impact: Missing opportunities

### **Email Format**:
```

## 🚨 6 Critical Needs Monitored

### **1. 🌐 Professional Domain Name**

**Triggers When**:
- Using localhost:3000
- Sent 10+ demo websites

**Problem**:
```
Demo links: http://localhost:3000/demo/joes-plumbing
Prospects see: "localhost" ❌
Looks unprofessional and suspicious
Links DON'T WORK for prospects (localhost only works on your computer)
```

**Impact**: -30-50% conversion (prospects don't trust localhost)

**Solution**:
1. Buy domain: https://www.namecheap.com/ ($12/year)
2. Point to hosting (Railway, Vercel)
3. Update DOMAIN in .env
4. Restart AI

**Priority**: HIGH

---

### **2. 📧 Email Limit Reached**

**Triggers When**:
- 80%: Warning (approaching limit)
- 100%: CRITICAL (limit reached)

**Problem**:
```
Free SendGrid: 100 emails/day
Your setting: 50 emails/day (MAX_EMAILS_PER_DAY)

At limit = cannot send emails = business stops
```

**Impact**:
- 80%: Will stop soon
- 100%: BUSINESS STOPPED ⚠️

**Solution**:
1. Upgrade SendGrid Essentials: $20/month (40K emails/month)
2. Go to: https://sendgrid.com/pricing/
3. Update SENDGRID_API_KEY in .env
4. Or increase MAX_EMAILS_PER_DAY if within quota

**Priority**: CRITICAL (when at 100%)

---

### **3. 🤖 API Quota Exceeded**

**Triggers When**:
- 80%: Warning (approaching quota)
- 100%: CRITICAL (quota exceeded)

**Problem**:
```
OpenAI monthly limit: $100 (default)
Usage: GPT-4 + DALL-E 3 for every website

At limit = AI stops working = no website generation
```

**Impact**:
- 80%: AI will stop soon
- 100%: ALL AI FEATURES DISABLED ⚠️

**Solution**:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits
2. Increase monthly usage limit to $200-300
3. AI resumes automatically

**Priority**: CRITICAL (when at 100%)

---

### **4. 💳 Stripe Payment Setup**

**Triggers When**:
- Have paying customers
- No Stripe API key configured

**Problem**:
```
Customers: 5 signed up
Stripe: NOT CONFIGURED

Closing sales but NOT GETTING PAID!
Losing $985/month ($197 × 5 customers)
```

**Impact**: Losing revenue every month

**Solution**:
1. Create Stripe account: https://stripe.com/register
2. Get API keys: dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
3. Add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to .env
4. AI starts collecting payments automatically

**Cost**: FREE (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)

**Priority**: CRITICAL (after first customer)

---

### **5. 📱 Twilio Phone Number**

**Triggers When**:

Cannot send SMS without phone number
Missing 30% of market
```

**Impact**: -30% potential leads

**Solution**:
1. Login: https://twilio.com/console
2. Buy phone number ($1/month)
3. Add TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER to .env
4. AI starts SMS outreach automatically

**Priority**: MEDIUM

---

### **6. ☁️ Cloud Hosting Needed**

**Triggers When**:
- Running localhost
- Have 3+ paying customers

**Problem**:
```
Running on your computer:
- Business stops when computer sleeps
- Not accessible 24/7
- Customers can't reach websites when computer off
```

**Impact**: Downtime = losing customers

**Solution**:
```
Option 1 - Railway (easiest):
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
Cost: $5/month

Option 2 - Vercel:
vercel login
vercel deploy
Cost: Free tier

Benefit: 24/7 uptime, always accessible
```

**Priority**: HIGH (after 3 customers)
